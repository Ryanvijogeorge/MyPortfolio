        <p>Hi and welcome to my journal.Here you'll see brief articles about how my day was.Hope you enjoy it!</p>
        
        <h2>March</h2>
        <h3>24/3/2021</h3>
        <p>This is my first journal entry.So today I had a playdate with my friend Tarun.We had a lot of fun.We played video games, we coded, animated, skated, ate pizza and watched TV.We animated the beginnings of a skateboarding animation.We had an idea in which the skateboarder in the animation does a 1260 degree on the mega-ramp and then bounces of a trampoline.We only had time to do till the part when the skater got off the ramp.We also played a video game called smash hit.I used to have that game in my Ipad.It's just a game in which you can tap balls and break virtual crystals and glass.It's very noisy.We coded too.I taught him how to make a browser.To ensure the user's safety, I coded so that the browser would not show you the website until and unless you wrote https:// before each url.We ate pizza for lunch.They bought chicken tikka pizza covered in green sauce.It was very scrumptious.My sister Ava was a little clingy to Tarun's sister Tanvi.We also watched a bit of TV.We got to watch the beginnings of the movie 'Spider man: Homecoming' before Ava came and wanted to watch one of her kid videos.She said "I will choose what to watch because I'm the guest!".Sometime after lunch, Tarun,Tanvi,Ava and I went out to play.I know how to skateboard so I showed Tarun how.But he didn't quite get the hang of it.I learnt how to do an ollie.But that's nothing compared to the 1260 degree aerial done by Mitchie Brusco in the X games.Here are a few pictures of him doing it. </p>

        <p> I know.Cool right.But it's a lot cooler when you watch the video.This is the link for it "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypccK00QOqg".You can copy it and paste it in the chrome bar above to watch the video.So now what I'm doing is writing this web page for everyone to know about my life.Oh and also I'm gonna give you some advice.Never bring your younger sister to hang out with your friends.If you do, Good luck everyone!</p>
